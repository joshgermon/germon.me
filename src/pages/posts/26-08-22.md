excerpt: Why is there no emmet support for CSS Modules?
---

# 26-08-22
## I really want emmet to work with CSS Modules and it bothers me it doesn't.

I just want to be able to write `.class-name` and have it auto complete to `<div className={styles['class-name']}></div>`. Not having to always delete the auto quotes added everytime.

Yes, being bothered by this is extremely silly.

I'll admit I've done a page one google search of this a couple times and haven't found anything that actually works. So maybe there are some custom solutions/hacks that work but nothing simple I've found that you setup in a couple minutes. Which is why I'm very surprised it's not as simple as a VSCode extension or native emmet support seeming CSS modules are so popular.

If you find anything - let me know.
