# 12-08-22

I see a lot of pieces of content or interesting tools and projects literally *every single* day on the internet.

I have tried to use extensions like TabStash or OneTab to keep my habit of __1,000,000__ tabs open in check but I never go back to them or forget they are there in the moment.

Or sometimes it's like, "I think I really need this tab to reference in the next 20 minutes so stashing it is pointless" but in realty I could reopen it if I do reference it and over 75% of the time I don't.

I could just dump a bunch of stuff here and pretend like it'll be different and I am not the problem.

## Also insignificant things to do on this site that'll I'll forget if I don't write them down:
- Find the best way to resort the array of markdown files I get back by date (add frontmatter date property and sort array before map?)
- Make the light mode toggle stateful between pages and sessions (although maybe it's light mode users, who cares?).
- Add a random dock/launcher thing at the bottom that looks really cool even though I have no idea what to use it for.
- Add a command palette in the same vein as the dock above.
