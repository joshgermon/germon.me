# 12-08-22

I see a lot of pieces of great content or interesting tools and projects every single day on the internet. However I've never found a way that works for me to bookmark it and come back to it.

I have tried to use extensions like TabStash or OneTab to keep my habit of __1,000,000__ tabs open in check but I never go back to them or forget they are there in the moment.

Or sometimes it's like, "I think I really need this tab to reference in the next 20 minutes so stashing it is pointless" but in realty I could reopen it if I do reference it and over 75% of the time I don't.

So my thinking is that I could instead just dump a bunch of stuff here and pretend like it'll better than much, much simpler and reasonable solutions.

## Also insignificant things to do on this site that'll I'll forget if I don't write them down:
- Sort these posts by date. I only just realised it's ordered back-the-front.
- Make the light mode toggle stateful between pages and sessions (although it is *only* light mode users, so no devs right? ðŸ™ƒ).
- Add a random dock/launcher thing at the bottom that looks really cool even though I have no idea what to use it for.
- Add a command palette in the same vein as the dock above.
