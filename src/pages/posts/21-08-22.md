## I discovered [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVRo68NByvE) today

It's a fantastic video and Theo does a great job explaining the issues these solutions help solve.

It has me very split though on these technologies; on the one hand DataUnlocker and proxying with Plausible is a clever way to get that important user data to help improve your product that can be vital to startups. On the other hand it feels somewhat *morally grey* to put further technologies in place to track users who have purposely tried to block this behaviour.

Now I know a lot of companies do explicitly state that they gather data and only want unidentifible mostly unimportant data; however it's always still deeply buried in T&Cs and ridiculously (but often intentionally) vague in how it's being used and what's being collected.

One thing I do really appreciate is the iOS App Store detailed privacy rundown that is required for each app. It's greatly reassuring to know what's your handing over when downloading a software to your personal device that knows more about you that probably any one person.

I'd love for websites in general to be more clear about what they're tracking and how they use the data but that's unfortuntely incredibly unrealistic.
