# 11-08-22

Hello, everyone.

This is my personal site I have recently re-built from Next.js to [Astro](https://astro.build) ðŸš€

This is intended to be a collection of random ideas and things I find interesting or the process in building side projects in anything from Typescript to Rust ðŸ¦€. 

But mainly as a very ridiculous and impractical solution to a simple, simple concept of a notepad for myself to remember my thoughts and ideas.

Or it could be nothing because I struggle to find the time or a way to remember to use this.

## Quick thoughts on Astro
- Tooling is fantastic including the create-astro CLI and the file structure and in-built router
- From the entire site being __245kb__ with Next.js (*no this site had no reason to be that big ever*) - to __under 38kb__
- Documentation is great; community sourced info and packages outside of it much more difficult to google (*"how to X astro build?"* or *how to X astro js?* because astro by itself never works)
- Super easy to get started and the markdown integration is so beyond simple vs something like Next & MDX it's incredible
- Scoped component styling is really great, wish SCSS was supporting within the style tag (mainly missing nesting). Possibly some better styling solutions for this as I look into it more
