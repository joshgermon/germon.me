### Alternate color mode flashes 

This is so frustrating to debug as everything works locally until pushed to deployment, which is always fun. Seems like it doesn't happen everytime either? Currently there is a blocking script before anything in the body gets rendered so theorectically it shouldn't flash. Which is how it plays out on local until pushed to production. 

### "Now Playing" component temperamental

Today when playing a song with a rather unique title, the Now Playing component crashed the site as it was expecting a certain parameter from the API call that wasn't received. Strangely this was the "open.spotify.com" link that goes directly to the song on your spotify client. This should just be as simple as implementing a conditional check on that specific property. 

### My fonts are missing

This must have happened at some point during my [SSR & deploying to the edge ordeal yesterday.](https://joshgermon.me/posts/16-08-22) I did remove the Astro font optimisation and add it back, so somewhere along the way it must've not been intergrated back correctly.
