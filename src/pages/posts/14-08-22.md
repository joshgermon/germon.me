# 14-08-22
Even though I really had no need too, I read through all of the new beta React docs.

And I know this really isn't news to anyone who has seen them. And initially I had skimmed over them and thought they were good, but they're even better than I thought.

The whole last section on effects in particular is fantastic.

You can read them here. https://beta.reactjs.org/
