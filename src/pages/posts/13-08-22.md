# 13-08-22

In my process of learning rust I have purposely tried to stick to building projects in new areas I don't often (or haven't) experience in Typescript/JS. Therefore I haven't played with any web frameworks until now as it felt too familiar.

This is also partially due to the ecosystem being so young that there's not a whole lot of consensus on what to get started with. Google "rust web framework" and you'll read everything from the Actix Web saga to one of the other most popular frameworks possibly being abandoned.

## Today I started playing with Axum. 

So far it's API has been great! And I like that it's created and backed by the creators of tokio.rs rust's main asynchronous runtime. 

However my one frustration is the get started example doesn't compile without ensuring your project (Cargo.toml) has the right dependencies and right features added to those dependencies which are not listed on the example. 

I feel I'm missing something here? Maybe I'm still not understanding the cargo ecosystem. That's certainly possible ðŸ™ƒ.
