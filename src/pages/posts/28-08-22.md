## Serverless limitations.

The one frustrating limitation I've run into a couple of times is the payload limit for each serverless function request.

On Vercel it is a maximum payload of 4.5MB request or response body. As far as I can see on their docs there's no way to increase this either.

With AWS Lambdas it is a hard 6MB limit for any single request.

There's technical reasons for these limits I understand and for most use cases this should not be an issue. Or maybe serverless is not the right approach for your app. However it's something I've run into a few times trying to build a quick concept or idea with a simple Next.js serverless API.
