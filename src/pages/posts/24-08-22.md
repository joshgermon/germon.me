## The resources for Rust and community is fantastic
In general, the resources that are available and high quality free, accessible content around Rust is amazing.

Extremely helpful for anyone looking to get started or progress in their own journey of learning Rust.

As annoying as the "rewrite X in rust" crowd can be the community geniunely is helpful and an asset to have. I have found it harder to find high quality C/C++ information sometimes.
