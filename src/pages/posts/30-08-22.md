## Weekly Content Roundup

Just a quick roundup of some of the best content or interesting sites I've seen this week. 

_This week's theme is definitely styles ðŸŽ¨._

### Articles & Snippets
- [Found this interesting example](https://github.com/branhillsdesign/MakerOS/blob/main/components/widgets/Button.js) of conditionally applied styles using Styled Components.
- Great resource for anyone looking for a [beginner project to implement in Rust](https://picklenerd.github.io/pngme_book/introduction.html) without following step-by-step tutorial. And it was super interesting learning a little about the PNG protocol.
- An article I feel I relate to often - [Styling React Sucks](https://ntgard.medium.com/react-styling-sucks-fc17b43084e6)
- [Josh W Comeau's simple CSS reset snippet](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/custom-css-reset/) is a great option that isn't as heavy-handed as other options.

### Tools & libraries
- [This CSS Modules babel plugin](https://github.com/gajus/babel-plugin-react-css-modules) I found that replaces 'className' with 'styleName' allowing you to write scoped CSS classnames like you would normally. I wrote about it and other solutions [here](https://joshgermon.me/posts/29-08-22).
- [CLSX is a tiny npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) (228 Bytes âœ¨) that allows you to easily conditionally apply class names in React.
- I have been meaning to check out [stitches.dev] - just need to find a project for it!
- Visualise JSON data as graphs - [JSON Visio](https://jsonvisio.com/)
